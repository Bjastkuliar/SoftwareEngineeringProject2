# SoftwareEngineeringProject2
Development of a series of UML diagrams for [the given problem specification](https://github.com/Bjastkuliar/SoftwareEngineeringProject2/blob/master/SE2021-PMS-Project-2.pdf).

## General information
This repo holds a series of UML diagrams (the type is understandable by the name of the diagram itself) all concerning the given specification. We started developing the diagrams from no.1 gradually making our way up to the 11th.
The tool we chose for developing said diagrams was [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/)(formerly known as [draw.io](https://draw.io)).

## Repo structure
The repo is divided into two folders, the source ones which are actually XML files and can be loaded and edited in [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/).
The SVG files can also be loaded into [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/), but were added for the simple purpose of having a "showable" format on the repo.
